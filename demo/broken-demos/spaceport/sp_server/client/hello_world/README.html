<H1>How to Run &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</H1>

This app loads a SWF into a browser window or an SGF (a converted SWF) onto a device.
<br>
<ol>
    <li>At the terminal &quot;cd&quot; into the &quot;hello_world&quot; directory.</li>
    <li>Launch a simple web-server to serve up the files.  On Mac, you can just type the following line: `sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`  That will serve the current directory up on port 80 of your computer.</li>
    <li>In a Web-Browser like Chrome or Firefox visit: &quot;http://localhost/index.html?platform=flash&quot;</li>
    <li>You should be able to play &quot;Hello, World!&quot; in your web-browser now using your Flash player.  This is the standard environment for development and testing of Spaceport games.</li>
    <li>Now install the iOS build on a device to test it using the Spaceport iOS renderer</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Open up SpPublic.xcodeproj in the SpPublic folder using X-Code.</li>
        <li>Connect the device that you would like to test with (iPhone / iPad / iPod).  Said device must already be provisioned with your team's provisioning profile so that you can code-sign.</li>
        <li>In X-Code select &quot;device&quot; and NOT &quot;simulator&quot; and pick the device that you just plugged in.</li>
        <li>Build and Run.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>Now that you have the &quot;Spaceport App&quot; installed on your iOS device, use it to open up &quot;Hello, World!&quot; that's running on your computer.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Determine your internal IP address.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>At another terminal type: &quot;ifconfig | grep inet&quot;</li>
            <li>The last line should have something like: &quot;inet 10.0.1.35 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.1.255&quot;  In this case, my internal IP is 10.0.1.35</li>
            <li>To verify that this is indeed the correct address, replace &quot;localhost&quot; with your IP in the previously used URL.  For example, I would not test in my browser using the URL: &quot;http://10.0.1.35/index.html?platform=flash&quot;</li>
          </ol>  
        <li>Make sure that your iOS device is connected to the same wifi network as your computer.</li>
        <li>Open the &quot;Settings&quot; menu on your iOS device.  Find &quot;Spaceport App&quot; under &quot;Apps&quot;.  Fill in the &quot;Server IP&quot; field.  For me, this would be: &quot;10.0.1.35/index.html&quot;</li>
        <li>Launch &quot;Spaceport App&quot;. &quot;Hello, World!&quot; will now load and run.</li>
      </ol>
</ol>

<H1>Modifying the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; Code</H1>

Using a text editor, open up the &quot;hello_world&quot; directory.  Make your changes and save them.
<br><br>
To view your changes in a browser, just select refresh and the updated game will now display.
<p>
To view your changes on an iOS device, first kill the currently running application. This is accomplished by double-pressing the home button to show a list of running applications, then touching and holding the &quot;Spaceport App&quot; icon in this list until it begins to shake.  The app can then be terminated by touching the red circle.  Launching the Spaceport App as indicated above will now display the updated game.
</p>
<p>
To debug, use either Firefox or Chrome.  Firefox has an add-on called Firebug, and Chrome has &quot;developer tools&quot; under the &quot;View &gt; Developer&quot; menu that will allow you set breakpoints, evaluate expressions, set watch expressions, inspect the call stack, etc.
