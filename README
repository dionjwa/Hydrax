Hydrax is a haXe port of the Pushbutton Engine (PBE).

Status: core functionality is done.  Next step is the XML parsing/templating system.

Why?  HaXe and the PBE are a natural fit.  

PBE is a good engine for building games, as the component plug-in architecture eases building of complex game objects with a minimum of code rewriting.  This component architecture also makes it easier to write games for different platforms, as different components can be used for different platforms in a natural way.

One goal of this port is to reduce unecessary dependencies where possible.  It should be possible to replace any core component or manager with your own.

HaXe provides an outright performance boost for games running in Flash, compared to games written in AS3.

Many games require server side functionality.  haXe compiles to several server-side languages/platforms, allowing a single language for the entire game development.

Currently, Hydrax will keep the PBE package structure of the core classes (with permission from Ben Garney, PB Labs).  This may change if Hydrax diverges sufficiently.

At this stage, portions of PBE are ported over as needed, endevouring to maintain a reasonable level of consistency.  Community contributions are encouraged.

See doc/differences_hydrax_pbe for a list of differences between Hydrax and PBE.
