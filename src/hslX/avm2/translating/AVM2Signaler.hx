	 * Creates a new AVM2 signaler. This signaler serves as a bridge between the ActionScript 3.0 event system, and this library.
	 * 
	 * The passed subject will be used as the subject of this signaler. Only the subject is allowed to call the dispatch method.
	 * Signals dispatched by this signaler will have the subject as current target, and in some cases as origin.
	 * 
	 * The passed native dispatcher is the object that dispatcher the events that will be translated. The native event type is
	 * the type of the events that will be translated. The native dispatcher can be the same as the subject, but it could be an
	 * other object, too.
	 * 
	 * If the reject null data flag is set, the signaler will throw an error if the subject attempts to dispatch a signal with
	 * null as data, or the the signaler is about to bubble a signal that contains null as data.
