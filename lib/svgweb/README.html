<p>The SVG Web toolkit uses Flash and JavaScript in order to bring static and dynamic SVG to web browsers, including Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>See the User Manual docs/UserManual.html for details on how to use SVG Web.</p>

<p>See the FAQ file docs/FAQ.html for general information.</p>

<p>To see a sample SVG file, view the samples/demo.html file. To see simple examples of using SVG Web in your own projects view the samples in samples/javascript-files/. To run the samples you must have a local web server running; they will not work correctly when run from file:// URLs. If you do not have a local web server the latest build is also running at http://codinginparadise.org/projects/svgweb/</p>

<p>If this is a source distribution, the ActionScript source is in src/org/svgweb/</p>
