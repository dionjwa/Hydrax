<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<div class="columns"><p>A lot of people have the idea that a successful "knowledge economy" requires much cheaper and faster broadband than what we have available in NZ today. I strongly disagree. If that was so, then Japan, South Korea and China would be dominating the United States in software development and Internet services, but they are not, or at least their strength is in volume, not innovation.
</p><p><a href="http://blogs.nzherald.co.nz/blog/start-ups-and-strategies/2009/9/8/why-lack-cheap-broadband-killing-our-knowledge-economy/?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10595895">This Herald blogger</a> suggests that if only we had faster, cheaper broadband, users would be figuring out amazing things to do with it. I don't understand this argument at all. <em>Users</em> can't do anything with broadband except use services provided by software developers. NZ's network is adequate enough to build and deploy any service developers can think of, and if you want to reach a mass market you can trivially host your services in the USA or elsewhere. (<a href="http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/">Chris Double</a> in our office runs <a href="http://tinyvid.tv/">TinyVid</a>, hosted in the USA, as a hobby, for goodness sake.)
</p><p>Major research universities in the USA often presented similar arguments to large funding agencies: give us a lot of money to build amazing infrastructure (networks, computers, etc) and cool new ideas will be spontaneously generated. I don't think that was ever really true; the great ideas seem to come from getting smart people together and giving them freedom to work on their interests with <em>adequate</em> supporting infrastructure to experiment on; I can't think of any examples of great ideas that were inspired by a superabundance of infrastructure. Sure, if you had a megabit network and no-one else did, or Unix workstations when everyone else had DOS PCs, you had an edge, but by the mid-90s when I entered grad school at CMU commodity PCs and networks were powerful enough to support cutting-edge research in most areas of computer science. That didn't stop the universities asking for infrastructure money though!
</p><p>Perhaps I could argue that making it easier to consume software and services is actually a long-term drag on the "knowledge economy". I got into programming because my first computer had almost no software on it and no way to get any more --- so all I could do with it was write my own. How many bright kids are hooked on Facebook, Youtube and game consoles when they could be coding their own dreams into reality?
</p><p>Based on my experiences I certainly have gripes about problems dragging on NZ's "knowledge economy", but broadband isn't one of them.</p></div></div>

<p>Recently, a <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/superfriends/">group of well known web designers</a> issued a "Super Friends" declaration of support or HTML5, with an attached <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/superfriends/guide/">set of concerns</a>. Most of the concerns had to do with the new "semantic markup" elements included in HTML5, such as section, article, and so on. I've not previously discussed these new semantic page markup elements, because I had other fish to fry. However, I decided to take a closer look at the elements, particularly at how I would use them for my Drupal sites.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<div class="columns"><p>I'm back in Auckland for one night before I head off again to California. The Australia trip was great. We roamed around Sydney visiting friends and relatives, but had a couple of days in the Blue Mountains on our own. The weather was great throughout. I achieved complete Internet independence for a week, no withdrawal symptoms.
</p><p>Like most of our trips there was lots of walking and lots of eating. The Blue Mountains were excellent --- great views, and really interesting geology and habitats, especially the way water trickles down the cliffs forming amazing "hanging swamps". We loved the Wentworth Falls area, especially the National Pass walk that descends from the top of the escarpment down through wet gullies and then along a shale ledge halfway up great Triassic sandstone cliffs, then up hundreds of steep steps beside the waterfall. The track's graded "hard", probably due to the staircases, and the nominal time is 3 to 4 hours, but we did it in 2:45 including lots of lookout stops ... not bad for my 4 year old son! We'd already walked 2.5 hours down the Giant Staircase and along Dardanelle Pass in Katoomba that morning. The following day we walked to the bottom of Govett's Leap falls and back up, also very nice, but a bit trickier due to wet rock surfaces, especially going down.
</p><p>If I'd realized before booking how much of the appeal of the Blue Mountains rests on peering over precipices and descending impossibly steep stairs, I might have had second thoughts on account of my fear of heights. Since I had a great time anyway, I'm glad I didn't know!
</p><p>Just before these walks I'd been reading <em>The Watchmen</em> (fabulous). I was struck by the contrast between that bleak vision of fallen humanity and the glorious beauty of God's creation. It's good to look away from man for a while.
</p><p>Movie roundup:
</p><ul>
<li>JJ Abrams' <em>Star Trek</em>: pretty good
</li><li><em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em>: better than expected, which isn't saying much
</li><li><a href="http://www.mrqe.com/movies/m100000885"><em>Shaolin Temple (1982)</em></a>: Jet Li's first major role. Otherwise not very interesting except that there are some astounding apparently real action sequences, where for example a man does handsprings without hands, just flipping over onto his head and then back up again.
</li><li><em>Roman Holiday</em>: Even better than I remembered, definitely a must-see
</li><li><em>Anna and the King</em>: How can you put two of my favourite actors, Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat, in starring roles and make such a terrible movie? I don't know, but it's not worth watching to try to find out. Upsetting.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Digital image manipulation is the altering of an image using computer program tools and software to produce a contrived image, often generating new meaning. It involves already existing imagery, such as photographs, films or videos, being subsequently worked on in a multitude of possible ways.   Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator  are still the best softwares to use when it comes to image manipulation.  But for the budget conscious and those just trying it out for the first time or working on personal</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<div class="columns"><p>Seems like a few people got close to the answer for the first problem. You formulate the condition for <em><b>q</b></em> being on the circle as a quadratic equation in <em>t</em>, and then apply the quadratic formula to solve for <em>t</em>. However, I can't give full credit to anyone because all the answers were incomplete; many ended containing a "plus or minus the square root ..." but a complete answer must describe which solution to pick. It's pretty easy to figure that out though. </p><p>My answer is<br />
<em>t</em> = (<em>a</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em><em>y</em> - √(<em>r</em>²(<em>x</em>² + <em>y</em>²) - (<em>a</em><em>y</em> - <em>b</em><em>x</em>)²))/(<em>a</em>² + <em>b</em>² - <em>r</em>²)<br />
where <em><b>p</b></em> = (<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) and <em><b>q</b></em> = (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>). The answer from Wolfram Alpha via Neil Rashbrooke is the same except it chooses the positive root; I think that's wrong, because it will give you a negative <em>t</em> (the denominator is negative).
</p><p>The second problem is harder. Even though it's intuitively "obvious" that a solution is always possible, I found it quite difficult to prove, and apparently so did my readers. I think Joshua Cranmer got close but I don't fully understand his answer and he didn't get a complete algorithm for finding the order.
</p><p>I start by observing that if you can find one rectangle to move safely then the solution to the whole problem follows by induction, since one moved rectangle can never overlap other moved rectangles, since they didn't overlap to start with. So the problem is reduced to finding one rectangle to move safely from the set of rectangles.
</p><p>I also observe that without loss of generality you can reduce the problem to the case where the components of <em><b>v</b></em> are non-negative, i.e., we are moving the rectangles down and to the right by some amount, possibly zero.
</p><p>Let's say rectangles <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> <b>overlap horizontally</b> if their projections onto the x-axis intersect. Similarly, they <b>overlap vertically</b> if their projections onto the y-axis intersect. Because our rectangles are non-overlapping, if <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> are different and overlap horizontally they cannot overlap vertically, and either <em>R</em> is <b>entirely above</b> <em>S</em> (every point in <em>R</em> is above (or on) the top edge of <em>S</em>) or <em>R</em> is <b>entirely below</b> <em>S</em> (every point in <em>R</em> is below (or on) the bottom edge of <em>S</em>).
</p><p>Consider the subset of rectangles <em>R</em> such that <em>R</em> has no rectangle entirely below it that it overlaps horizontally. These rectangles do not overlap each other horizontally. Choose the "rightmost" rectangle from this set, let's call it <em>M</em>. I claim no other rectangle intersects <em>M</em> + <b>v</b>. This solves the problem.
</p><p>The proof is still subtle. We have to show that our subset is non-empty, i.e., that at least one rectangle has no rectangles below it that it overlaps horizontally. This is easy though, since rectangle with the lowest bottom-edge certainly has no rectangles below it. So such an <em>M</em> exists.
</p><p>Of course the hard part is to show that no other rectangle intersects <em>M</em> + <em><b>v</b></em>. We can show that in fact no rectangles are below <em>M</em>'s top edge and to the right of <em>M</em>'s left edge (other than <em>M</em> itself). Let's call this set <em>S</em>. I'll show <em>S</em> is empty, by assuming <em>S</em> is nonempty and working to a contradiction.
</p><p>Clearly there can be no rectangles below <em>M</em>'s top edge that overlap <em>M</em> horizontally, or they would have to be below <em>M</em> and we wouldn't have put <em>M</em> in that subset. So every rectangle in <em>S</em> would have to be entirely to the right of <em>M</em>. So choose out <em>S</em> one rectangle that has the lowest bottom edge rectangles in <em>S</em>. Let's call it <em>P</em>. I will show that <em>P</em> has no rectangles entirely below it that it overlaps horizontally, so it should have been part of the initial subset, which contradicts our choice of <em>M</em> as the rightmost rectangle in that subset, thus showing that no such <em>P</em> exists and <em>S</em> is empty.
</p><p>Clearly no rectangle in <em>S</em> is below <em>P</em> and overlaps <em>P</em> horizontally. What about the rectangles not in <em>S</em>? Suppose a rectangle <em>Q</em> is not in <em>S</em>, is entirely below <em>P</em> and overlaps <em>P</em> horizontally. The left edge of <em>Q</em> must be at or to the left of the left edge of <em>M</em>, otherwise <em>Q</em> would be in <em>S</em>. The right edge of <em>Q</em> must be to the right of the right edge of <em>M</em>, since <em>Q</em> overlaps <em>P</em> horizontally. So <em>Q</em> also overlaps <em>M</em> horizontally. The bottom edge of <em>Q</em> is below the bottom edge of <em>P</em> which is below the top edge of <em>M</em>, so <em>Q</em> must be entirely below <em>M</em> --- but this is impossible, since we chose <em>M</em> to have no rectangle overlapping horizontally below it.
</p><p>Phew! That's not easy for something so "obvious".
</p><p>This solution should make for a reasonably efficient algorithm.
</p><ol>
<li>Sort the rectangles by right edge.
</li><li>Set R to the rightmost rectangle.
</li><li>If R has any rectangles overlapping horizontally below it, set R to the one of those rectangles with the rightmost right edge and go to step 3.
</li><li>Move R.
</li><li>Remove R from our list.
</li><li>If there are more rectangles in the list, go to step 2.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Update</strong> Actually I'm pretty sure you can do a direct proof of correctness of the above algorithm. At the beginning of step 3 you have the invariant that there are no rectangles to the right of the right edge of R and below the top edge of R. Using that invariant, I think you can construct a much simpler proof than the one I gave here.
</p><p>Also, as at least one commenter observed, you can improve this algorithm by not throwing away all your work every time you go to step 2. That adds complexity though...
</p><p><strong>Update</strong> Fixed a typo in the answer to the first problem, pointed out by Boris.</p></div></div>
