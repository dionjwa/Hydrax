<h1>SVG Web Sizing Strategy</h1>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
This document is provided for historical and informational purposes but should
not be used as a reference.
</p>
<p>
I believe the observations are accurate and the strategies described in this document
are pretty much what was initially coded into SVG Web. However, when it comes to
specific sizing behavior in specific scenarios, this document should not be considered
an accurate and up-to-date reference.
</p>
<p>
This document was written early in the design of SVG Web sizing behavior and there may
be mistakes in it and also, since then, bugs have been fixed and there are new generations
of browsers and behavior may have changed.

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
The goal of this project is to define a consistent SVG sizing behavior for SVG
Web to emulate when used in flash mode. Different browsers size SVG images
in different ways, and so we have decided to pick one browser behavior and
implement that consistently on all browsers so that web developers can
rely on consistent behavior without having to implement that themselves.
</p>

<p>
When an object tag is used to embed an SVG image, the size of the object
can be different from the size of the SVG image that is rendered within it.
These can be considered two different layers of sizing and clipping.
</p>

<p>
With some browsers (e.g. Opera,Firefox 3.x) native implementations,
object sizing can utilize the SVG sizing parameters when either the
object height or width is not specified.
</p>

<p>
Both Opera and Firefox have made different choices with respect to sizing.
The issues are complex enough that it is not clear what behavior is more
correct or desirable in various circumstances. Safari, on the other hand
has some clear shortcomings that call out to be patched over.
</p>

<p>
The question is what behavior should SVG Web simulate for the automatic
object sizing? Should it simulate the browser native rendering of whatever
browser is being used? What about Safari with its shortcomings and IE which
has no native behavior? Should we consider using a common sizing behavior
for all browsers? (Just asking. I know this has serious issues.)
</p>

<p>
Before answering those questions, the current native behavior of the
different browsers should be considered.
</p>

<p>
This document describes, for the different browsers, how object sizing
logic works and how SVG sizing and scaling works within the object
boundaries.
</p>

<p>
In the Flash Scaling section, we describe what purpose automatic Flash
scaling is good for and why we do not use it.
</p>


<h2>
Overview
</h2>

<h3>
Safari
</h3>
<p>
With Safari 4.0.3 native rendering, the object is sized completely
independent of the svg sizing parameters (width, height, viewBox,
preserveAspectRatio). Percentages on the object refer to the parent
node and percentages on the SVG refer to the object size. 
If pixels or percentages are not provided on the object tag, the
object width defaults to 300 and the object height defaults to 150.
Obviously, this is simple and easiest to implement, but it means
the Safari browser requires manually specifying the object height
and width to match the svg height and width or you end up stuck
with 300x150. This seems to be a serious shortcoming.
</p>


<h3>
Mozilla
</h3>
<p>
Mozilla recognized that the simple 300 x 150 object default size 
is a not ideal for SVG files because SVG files specify a preferred
height and width and should not be considered different from other
images that do not have to specify their size.
(See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321531 and
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=294086).
As of Firefox 3, object sizing utilizes the SVG sizing parameters
when either the object height or width is not specified.
</p>

<h3>
Opera
</h3>
<p>
Opera 9.64 also utilizes the svg sizing parameters when either the
object height or width is not specified. It has similar logic to
firefox does but it made different choices in certain circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The common scenario is when an svg width and height is provided
in pixels in the svg tag. The two variations of that scenarios
are when the svg image is included with an object tag that has
a both a width and height or neither of them.
</p>

<p>
In the case where neither object width or height are provided, Firefox
and Opera will both use the svg width and height (if it is pixels)
to size the object. Safari however uses an object size of 300x150.
</p>

<p>
In the case where the object height and width is specified in the object
tag, and the svg file has a viewBox, firefox will scale the viewBox
into the object area, but Opera and Safari will scale the viewBox
into the svg height and width, regardless of the object size. In case
of size mismatches, Opera will add scroll bars to the object while
Safari clips.
</p>

<p>
The rules for Firefox and Opera get complex because you can have
pixel, percentages, or missing values for object height,
object width, svg height, and svg width and there seems to be
a different behavior for every circumstance.
</p>

<p>
It is worth mentioning that after the object is sized, the svg
height and width are used, generally, as follows:
</p>

<p>
For Safari:
</p>
<p>
The svg height and width determine size of the SVG
'canvas' within the object area. If the width or height
exceeds the object area, the svg file is clipped.
If it is smaller, the svg file does not fill the
whole area (respecting preserveAspectRatio).
</p>

<p>
For Opera & FF:
</p>
<p>
The svg height and width are used in various ways, if they are
used at all. The rules below define how they are used.
</p>

<h3>
IE
</h3>
<p>
For IE, we will have to pick an object sizing behavior since there is
no native object/SVG sizing behavior. (We pick Mozilla/Firefox).

<h2>
Object and SVG Sizing Behavior
</h2>

<p>
These are my observations of browser behavior, which SVG Web will try to emulate.
Specifically, SVG Web is emulating the behavior of the latest version
of Mozilla/FireFox. The rationale is that this is the browser with the highest
market share that supports SVG natively. We have made the design decision
with SVG Web that we should pick one sizing behavior and implement that
consistently instead of trying to emulate the behavior of the 
browser we are running on. Users will expect sizing to be consistent and
if we do not implement that, then everyone using SVG Web will have to
fix it themselves.
Also, choosing a single behavior was pretty much a no brainer when it
became clear that the behavior of some browsers was less than ideal.

CSS1Compat (FF only)
----------

If both object width and height are specified:
   The object width is used directly.
   For object height:
       If object height is pixels that is used.
       If the object height is %:
           If width and height are both specified on the SVG file in pixels,
               then the height is calculated based on the object width and the
               aspect ratio between the svg height and width.
               If viewBox is specified:
                   ClipMode: UseNone
               If viewBox is not specified:
                   ClipMode: UseBoth
           else
               If viewBox is specified:
                   The object height is calculated using the svg width
                   and the aspect ratio from the viewBox.
                   ClipMode: UseNone
               If viewBox is not specified:
                   If the svg height is in pixels use that.
                   If the svg height is missing or %:
                       The object height is 150px.
                   ClipMode: UseBoth

If neither object width nor height are specified:
    Use BackCompat mode


If object width is specified, but object height is not specified:
    Use BackCompat mode


If only object height is specified:
    If object height is pixels that is used.
        If width and height are both specified on the SVG file in pixels,
            then the object width is calculated based on the object height and the
            aspect ratio between the svg height and width.
        else
            If viewBox is specified:
                Then the width is calculated based on the object height
                and the aspect ratio on the viewBox.
                ClipMode: UseNone
            else
                If the object width is the svg width
                ClipMode: UseBoth
    else
        The object width is the svg width.
        If the svg height is in pixels use that for height
        else
            If viewBox is specified:
                Then the height is calculated based on the object width
                and the aspect ratio on the viewBox.
                ClipMode: UseNone
            else
                height is 150
                



BackCompat
----------

If both object width and height are specified:
    Height and width are used directly for the size of the object/embed.
    This applies whether the dimensions are provided as a percentage,
    or any unit of measure like pixels, or a mix of both.
    This is the same for FF, Safari, and Opera.
    
    With respect to SVG rendering:
        If viewBox is specified:
            On Safari and Opera, if svg width and height are specified,
                then they are used to specify the area of the object
                that the viewBox will be rendered within (respecting
                preserveAspectRatio).
                (On Opera only, if svg width/height exceeds object bounds,
                scroll bars appear.)
            On Firefox, svg width and height are ignored here and the area
                the viewBox is rendered in (respecting preserveAspectRatio)
                fills the entire object area.
                ClipMode: UseNone

        If viewBox is not specified:
            Then svg width and height are used
            as clipping areas within the object area and the default viewBox
            is matched to the width and height so no scaling is done.
            SVG sizes exceeding the object area are clipped.
            ClipMode: UseBoth


If neither object width nor height are specified:
    On Safari the object defaults to 300px by 150px.

    On Opera object width is taken from the svg element (defaulting
        defaulting to 100% if not present). Percentages are based on the
        parent node.

        An SVG width percentage further determines the area of
        the object that will be available for rendering.

        For height:
          If height is specified on the SVG in pixels, then that is used.
          If height is specified in percentage:
            If viewBox is specified:
                The object height is calculated using the svg width
                and the aspect ratio from the viewBox.
                The area the viewBox is rendered in (respecting
                preserveAspectRatio) fills the entire object area
                available for rendering.

            If viewBox is not specified:
                An object height of 150px is used.
                SVG renders without scaling.

            An SVG height percentage further determines the area of
            the object that will be available for rendering.
            ClipMode: UseHeight



    On Mozilla/FF, object width is taken from the svg element (defaulting
        to 100% if not present). Percentages are based on the parent
        of the object.
        
        The svg width is not used further in svg rendering.

        For height:
          If height is specified on the SVG in pixels, then that is used.
          If height is specified in percentage:
            If viewBox is specified: 
                The object height is calculated using the svg width
                and the aspect ratio from the viewBox.
                SVG height percentages do not appear to have any effect in
                this scenario.
                ClipMode: UseNone

            If viewBox is not specified:
                An object height of 150px is used.
                An SVG height percentage further determines the area of
                the object that will be available for rendering.
                ClipMode: UseHeight


    
If object width is specified, but object height is not specified:

    On Safari the object height defaults to 150px.

    On Opera, for the object height:
       If the viewBox is specified, 
           Then the object height is calculated based on the object width
           and the aspect ratio on the viewBox.
           An svg width or height determines the portion of the object
           area that the viewBox will be rendered within
           starting from the top left corner of the object (defaulting to 100%).
           An svg height percentage determines the portion of
           the object area that the viewBox will be rendered within.
           The viewBox renders into resulting area.
       else if the viewBox is not specified,
           If svg height is % or missing:
               The object height is 150px.
               The svg rendering height % is relative to 150px and
               starts from the top edge of the object (defaulting to 100%).
           If svg height is pixels:
               The object (and the svg rendering) height is the svg height.
           SVG renders without scaling.
           The svg width determines the portion of the object
           area that the viewBox will be rendered within
           starting from the left edge of the object (defaulting to 100%).
           
               
    On FF, for the object height:
       If the viewBox is specified, 
           If width and height are both specified on the SVG file in pixels,
               then the height is calculated based on the object width and the
               aspect ratio between the svg height and width.
               The viewBox scales into resulting area (honoring preserveAspectRatio).
               SVG height and width are not using in actual rendering.
           else
               Then the height is calculated based on the object width
               and the aspect ratio on the viewBox.
               The viewBox renders into resulting area. Note there will
               be no borders inside the object because the SVG scales
               exactly into the available space (because the aspect resolution
               was matched).
               SVG height and width are not used at all.
           ClipMode: UseNone
       else if the viewBox is not specified,
           If width and height are both specified on the SVG file in pixels,
               then the height is calculated based on the object width and the
               aspect ratio between the svg height and width.
               The viewBox scales into resulting area (honoring preserveAspectRatio).
           else
               If svg height is % or missing:
                   The object height is 150px.
                   The svg rendering height % is relative to 150px and
                   starts from the top edge of the object (defaulting to 100%).
               If svg height is pixels:
                   The object (and the svg rendering) height is the svg height.
           SVG renders without scaling.
           The svg width determines the portion of the object
           area that the viewBox will be rendered within
           starting from the left edge of the object (defaulting to 100%).
           ClipMode: UseBoth

               


If only object height is specified:
    On Safari the object width defaults to 300px.

    On Opera, for the object width:
       If the viewBox is specified, 
           Then the width is calculated based on the object height
           and the aspect ratio on the viewBox.
           An SVG width percentage determines the portion of
           the object area that the viewBox will be rendered within.
           An SVG height percentage determines the portion of
           the object area that the viewBox will be rendered within.
           The viewBox renders into resulting area.
       else if the viewBox is not specified,
           The object width is taken from the svg width (defaulting to 100%).

           The svg width is ALSO used for the svg clipping region.
           So the same svg percent is used both to size the object and
           the svg file within the object. Okay...

           The svg height is used to define the svg rendering
           area inside the object. Percents are relative to the object
           height. No value defaults to 100%.

           Exceeding the object area results in scroll bars
           

    On FF, for the object width:
       Object tag height is used for object, whether % or pixels.
       If viewBox is specified:
           If width and height are both specified on the SVG file in pixels,
               then the object width is calculated based on the object height and the
               aspect ratio between the svg height and width.
           Else
               Then the width is calculated based on the object height
               and the aspect ratio on the viewBox.
           The viewBox scales into resulting area (honoring preserveAspectRatio).
           SVG height and width are not used further in actual rendering.

<h2>
3. Flash Scaling
</h2>

<p>
The SVG drawing coordinates are draw initially to the flash
coordinate system which, by default, are then mapped to browser coordinates.
The "preferred" size of the SVG Web flash "movie" and the resulting
coordinate system are define at flash compile time. The width and height
of the flash coordinate system is defined at the top of SVGViewerWeb.as
in the [SWF] directive. Currently, this is 2048 by 1024. 
</p>

<p>
When you use SVG Web in your web page you specify a height and
width (probably in the &lt;object&gt; tag) and then the flash coordinates are
mapped into that height and width by flash. Flash uses the Stage.scaleMode
parameter to determine exactly how the scaling is done. By default,
it sizes the image to the object to a size which allows you to see
the entire image within the area, preserves the aspect ratio, and
is as large as possible within those constraints ("showAll").
</p>

<p>
For example, if we use the default flash scaling mode, and 
you specify a width and height of an SVG object as 512 by 256 (which
applies to the resulting flash object) then the image will appear
four times smaller than would be rendered by SVG if rendered
natively because it must scale the 2048x1024 flash coordinates
each by .25 to fit into the 512x256 area.
</p>

<p>
In the default scaling mode, flash attempts to scale the flash coordinate
system (2048 x 1024) into the object space. If the object area is square,
then there would be borders above and below the flash object.
</p>

<p>
The problem with the above arises when the top svg element
uses a viewbox or width/height that is more tall than wide. In this case,
when the browser renders the SVG natively, it correctly places borders
on the sides. However, in our case, unless we specify an object size that
is wider in aspect resolution than 2048x1024 (unlikely), flash resizing
still places the borders on the top and bottom because it still thinks the
flash area is more wide than tall (2048x1024) when compared to the object
area.
</p>

<p>
The flash plugin is not aware of the svg size or aspect ratio. It is only
aware of its own coordinate space (2048x1024), which is fixed at compile time.
Therefore, we cannot rely on flash resizing to help us scale the svg the
right way. We must disable flash scaling with the "noScale" mode and
performing the scaling manually in the rendering code.
</p>
