This is a sample that MichaelN put together. It's been the primary we benchmark performance. The URL is at <http://vis.uell.net/gsvg/poppyr.html>. MichaelN based his test on code that was itself taken from <destatis.de>. The version here was pulled around August 30th, 2009 from the <vis.uell.net> URL above. We do not have permission to redistribute it; it is only for testing and performance benchmarking as its a good sample of SVG.
