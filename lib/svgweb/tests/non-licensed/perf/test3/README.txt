These are sample files provided by MichaelN in Issue 218 (http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/issues/detail?id=218). They are meant to get loading static SVG in Firefox/Native faster. The bottleneck is probably somewhere inside of SVG Web. I assume the copyright on these is held by MichaelN for the work he is doing and are not to be re-distributed outside of our non-licensed testing directory.
