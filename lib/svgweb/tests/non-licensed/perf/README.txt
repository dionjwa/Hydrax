This subdirectory has various small unit tests around performance, helping to microbenchmark various operations. It's more of a working directory, useful to check in if later we want to come around and do performance testing again. It can probably be removed at some point. In test1/ is a subset of the code from the non-licensed/population demo from MichaelN. In test2/ is benchmarking around direct Flash/JS communication. In baseline/ is a baseline source that we might be using to see if performance optimizations are doing anything; see that directories README.txt file for what release version is in there.
