	 * Creates a new dynamic function signaler. This signaler serves as a bridge between the haXe "dynamic function" system, and
	 * this library.
	 * 
	 * The passed subject will be used as the subject of this signaler. Only the subject is allowed to call the dispatch method.
	 * Signals dispatched by this signaler will have the subject as current target, and in some cases as origin.
	 * 
	 * The passed dispatcher is the object that uses the dynamic function system. The signaler will look for a function with the
	 * name of the passed function name inside that dispatcher.
	 * 
	 * If the skip presence check flag is set, no "The passed dispatcher does not have a X field." exceptions are thrown.
	 * 
	 * If the reject null data flag is set, the signaler will throw an error if the subject attempts to dispatch a signal with
	 * null as data, or the the signaler is about to bubble a signal that contains null as data.
	 * 
	 * In this examle the "Loader" class uses the dynamic function signaler:
	 * <pre>
	 * package;
	 * import haxe.Http;
	 * import hsl.haxe.translating.DynamicFunctionSignaler;
	 * import hsl.haxe.Signaler;
	 * class Loader {
	 * 	public var dataReceivedSignaler(default, null):Signaler&lt;String&gt;
	 * 	private var http:Http;
	 * 	public function new(url:String):Void {
	 * 		http = new Http(url);
	 * 		dataReceivedSignaler = new DynamicFunctionSignaler(this, http, "onData");
	 * 	}
	 * 	public function load():Void {
	 * 		http.request(false);
	 * 	}
	 * }
	 * </pre>
